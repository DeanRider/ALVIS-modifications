# ALVIS-modifications
Bespoke java code and jar files for ALVIS to assist color blind users and to scale contigs based on length.

If you have an existing install of ALVIS, simply add the AlvisBR.jar or AlvisYB.jar to your existing /dist folder and use as directed.
If you wish to rebuild one of the versions of ALVIS using ant, replace the .java files posted here with those that came with Alvis and compile the code.
These instructions are intentionally vague because the original ALVIS site covers the processes very well.
